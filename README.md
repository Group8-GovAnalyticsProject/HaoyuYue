I found the *park visiting mobility pattern data in Washington State* pre COVID and during the pandemic (2020.4 & 2021.4). This data is published by *Safegraph* https://www.safegraph.com/ . So, I would like to use these datasets to do research on Covid, park and mobility. During data processing, I mainly remove some colunms, rename column names, and reshape some data for both 2020.4 and 2021.4.
